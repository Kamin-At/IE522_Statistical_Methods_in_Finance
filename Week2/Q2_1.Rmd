## Q2.1
Answer: No, a normal distribution does not fit the daily-return data well especially at the areas around the tails and peak of the histogram because of its fat-tail behavior (kurtosis higher than 3).

```{r cars}
library(ISLR)

n = nrow(Smarket)

dates = read.csv("C:/Users/kamin/OneDrive/Documents/min/mfe/uiuc/Fall2023/Stats_for_Fin/Week2/ISLRSmarketDates.csv", header=TRUE);
sp = data.frame(dates, Smarket[,-1])

sample_mean = mean(sp$Today)
sample_sd= sd(sp$Today)

x = seq(0, 1, by = 0.01)

par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
hist(sp$Today, breaks = 50, freq=FALSE)
curve(dnorm(x,sample_mean,sample_sd),add=TRUE,col="red",lwd=2)

hist(sp$Today, breaks = 50, freq=FALSE, xlim=c(2,6),ylim=c(0,0.1))
curve(dnorm(x,sample_mean,sample_sd),add=TRUE,col="red",lwd=2, xlim=c(2,6),ylim=c(0,0.1))
```
