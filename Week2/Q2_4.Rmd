## Q2.4
Answer: I investigated the day when the negative peak in Today occurred on SPY ETF (09/17/2001). The data point should be legitimate because such extreme value actually came from the actual financial crisis in 2001 (9/11 case).

```{r cars}
library(ISLR)


n = nrow(Smarket)

dates = read.csv("C:/Users/kamin/OneDrive/Documents/min/mfe/uiuc/Fall2023/Stats_for_Fin/Week2/ISLRSmarketDates.csv", header=TRUE);
sp = data.frame(dates, Smarket[,-1])
n = nrow(sp)


boxplot(sp$Today)
print(min(sp$Today))

sp[order(sp$Today, decreasing = FALSE), ][1:3,]
```
