## Q2.5

Answer: To answer the question, I plotted 2 graphs. The first one is the correlation matrix of all the data, and I did not find any significant linear relationship among all the variables. The second graph is to explore the non-linear relation among features. I think there is some weak relationships between the returns and Volume. When the volume is high, the returns tend to be a little bit less diverge.

```{r cars}
library(ISLR)
library(corrplot)

n = nrow(Smarket)

dates = read.csv("C:/Users/kamin/OneDrive/Documents/min/mfe/uiuc/Fall2023/Stats_for_Fin/Week2/ISLRSmarketDates.csv", header=TRUE);
sp = data.frame(dates, Smarket[,-1])
n = nrow(sp)

corrplot(cor(sp[,2:8]), method="number")
pairs(sp[,2:8])
```
