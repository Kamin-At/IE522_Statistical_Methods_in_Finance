## Q2.6 Week6
# So, the confidence interval with 95% confidence level is $$\mu_{D} \in [-0.002063498, \infty)$$, which is consistent with my conclusion in question 2.5 as $$\bar{D} = -0.0008377696 \in [-0.002063498, \infty)$$ .

```{r cars}
library(moments)

mu0 = 0
alpha = 0.05

data = read.csv("C:/min/coding_project/IE522_Statistical_Methods_in_Finance/Week6/TSLANVDA.csv")
log_ret_tsla = diff(log(data$TSLAAdjClose), lag=1)
log_ret_nvda = diff(log(data$NVDAAdjClose), lag=1)
D = log_ret_tsla - log_ret_nvda
se = sd(D)/sqrt(length(D))
mean(D)
lb = mu0 + se*qnorm(p = alpha)
cat("The lower bound of mu_D:",lb)
